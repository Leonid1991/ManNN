# ManNN

These programs are to demonstrate my abilities to solve classification problems given by Manchester Uni. with NN.

It has three distinct parts: Myopia, PAPILA & TREND problems.

	Myopia - https://shorturl.at/ASTY5
 	PAPILA - https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/PAPILA/14798004/1
  	TREND  - https://zenodo.org/records/4521044 (taken only segmented files and copied to images/old & images/young, respectively)

  Myopia problem (finished):
    ManchesterNN.py is a simple NN without any hidden layer based on data in Myopia_Data.xlsx
    ManchesterNN_opt.py provides an example of how some of the hyperparameters could be optimized

  PAPILA (not finished):
      UutilsProv.py is a file provided by authors for easier operation.   
      PAPilaMamchester.py gives a simple NN to operate with it.
      
  TREND (not finished):
    Here are two possible ways to work with the problem :  
    1. Using only files attributed to young people and their separation into healthy and obesity groups
    2. Combination of young and old to find their differences.
	 Note! It is a small number of files, especially for older people. To resolve it, the file extensionDataset.py was added. 
   	 To create additional folders and separate extended dataset dataPreparation.py was added.
