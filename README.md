# ManNN

These programs are to demonstrate my abilities to solve classification problems given by Manchester Uni. with NN.

It has three distinct parts: Myopia & TREND problems.
Links : 
	Myopia - https://shorturl.at/ASTY5
 	TREND  - https://zenodo.org/records/4521044 (taken only segmented files and copied to images/old & images/young, respectively)

  Myopia problem (finished):
    ManchesterNN.py is a simple NN without any hidden layer based on data in Myopia_Data.xlsx
    ManchesterNN_opt.py provides an example of how some of the hyperparameters could be optimized
      
  TREND (finished):
    Here are two possible ways to work with the problem :  
    1. Using only files attributed to young people and their separation into healthy and obesity groups
    2. Combination of young and old to find their differences.
	 Note! It is a small number of files, especially for older people. To resolve it, the file extensionDataset.py was added. 
   	 To create additional folders and separate extended dataset dataPreparation.py was added.
