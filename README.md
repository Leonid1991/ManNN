# ManNN

These programs are to demonstrate my abilities to solve classification problems given by Manchester Uni. with NN.

It has three distinct parts: Myopia, papila, PAPILA & TREND problems.

  Myopia problem (finished):
    ManchesterNN.py is a simple NN without any hidden layer based on data in Myopia_Data.xlsx
    ManchesterNN_opt.py provides an example of how some of the hyperparameters could be optimized

  PAPILA (not finished):
      UutilsProv.py is a file provided by authors for easier operation.   
      PAPilaMamchester.py gives a simple NN to operate with it.
  TREND (not finished):
    Here are two possible ways to work with the problem:
    1. Using only files attributed to young people and their separation into healthy and obesity groups
    2. Combination of young and old to find their differences.
	  Note! It is a small number of files, especially for older people. To resolve it, the file extensionOldDataset.py was added.
